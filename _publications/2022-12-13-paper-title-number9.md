excerpt: 'This article analyses the first stages of the process of labour market formation in the sun and sand tourism industry in Spain. The study focuses on the impact of the emergent sun and sand mass tourism in the model of industrial relations inherited from the pre-Civil War and the first Franco period. To do so, firstly it shows the characteristics of the post-war tourism labour market, the labour regulatory framework established by the dictatorship and its adaptation to the emergent new tourism model. Secondly, the paper explores the effect of the economic recovery in the mid-fifties on the characteristics of the labour markets of the tourism industry in the regions experiencing the Spanish tourism boom.'
