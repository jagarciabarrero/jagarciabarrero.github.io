excerpt: 'The Balearic Islands are a region of Spain with a characteristic that defines it in the economic panorama: it is a leader in mass tourism within the framework of the European Union. With a census population of 1.2 million inhabitants in 2024, the islands receive about 16 million tourists per year (the data is from 2023): more than 20% of all tourism that arrives in Spain. Therefore, we are facing one of the most important economies in mature tourism services, one of the most potent tourist archipelagos in the world. With clear business pioneering, Spain's most prominent hotel companies are firms based in the Balearic Islands, which forged their capital from other productive sectors. It, however, infers significant ecological externalities derived from this development model: demographic over-saturation, enormous consumption of natural capital and socio-cultural dislocations, as clear exponents of the other side of economic growth. In this context, the work presents the importance of the historical industrial trajectory in the Balearic Islands. It emphasizes, above all, the resistance capacity of footwear in the current economic structure of the Balearic Islands due to its historical ability to work with external markets and adapt to demand requirements.
