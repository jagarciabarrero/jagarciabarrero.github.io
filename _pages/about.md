Welcome
======
I am a Margalida Comas postdoctoral researcher at the University of the Balearic Islands and a Jordi Nadal Center for Economic History Studies research fellow. I have a PhD degree in economic history from the University of Barcelona, the University Carlos III of Madrid and the University of Valencia.

My research interests mainly concern the study of labour markets, migration and tourism, some of the key socio-economic debates in Spain, from a historical perspective. Particularly, I study the impact and determinants of internal circular migration, the formation of the Spanish tourism labour market and the historical prevalence of flexible labour and its consequences. I have published my findings in Economic History Review, Cliometrica, Journal of Iberian and Latin American Economic History, Social Science History, Annals of Tourism Research, among others.
